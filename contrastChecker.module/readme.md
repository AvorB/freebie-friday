<h1> Contrast Checker </h1>

In times where accessibility takes a huge role - everybody should check or at least consider to check their color palette for good contrast so their users have a great user experience. 

That's why I've created a global HubSpot module for that. Drop it onto a (landing) page or blog post and provide this extra bit of service for your clients/visitors.
