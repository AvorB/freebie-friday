<h1>Enhanced Favicon</h1>
<p>This module will give you more options and more control over favicon(s). For most cases it's onyl for the case somebody creates a shortcut icon to your page on his/her desktop/device.<p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>I recommend to put it somewhere in your main layout HTML like base.html. Consider to position it as far forward as possible. By doing so it will appear as one of the first modules in the page builder.</p>

<h2>Options</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Override Favicon(boolean): Enable this option to get all options. If it's disabled the module won't do anything and HubSpot will use the default favicon which will be set in the Hub settings(Settings > Website > Pages > Branding)</li>
    <li>Favicon(image): select/upload your custom favicon image</li>
    <li>Microsoft settings(group):
        <ul>

            <li>Custom name(text): <strong>Only visible if the previous option is enabled</strong>. Give your name a custom name. Will be used as name for Windows tiles</li>
            <li>Tile color(color): Set a background color for Windows tiles. <strong> Only HEX colors will work</strong></li>
            <li>Use custom image(boolean): Enable this if you would like to have a different image for Microsoft devices</li>
            <li>Favicon(image): select/upload your custom Microsoft favicon image</li>
